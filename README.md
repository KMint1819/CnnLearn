# CnnLearn
A repository for implementing neural networks from scratch or notes about NN knowledge.

## Future features:
- Pooling
- Conv: 3d kernel
- Activation
- Fully connected
- Random parameters (Random kernels)
- Even value of input size or kernel size of Conv
- Backward
- Evaluation
- Model zoo(Resnet, Inception, EfficientNet)
- Use np.dot instead of four for loops.
- Model training data(Cost time, accuracy...)
